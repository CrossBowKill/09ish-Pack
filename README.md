# 2009ish
[Download](https://github.com/CrossBowKill/best-interface)

This is a mix of the 2010 Style by [Shredit](https://github.com/ShreditRS) and the [Vanilla](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs/archive/sample-vanilla.zip) you can Download from [Melkypie](https://github.com/melkypie) but with the "older" 08-09 ish Skill-Icons
</br>
Did not really like the updated prayer icons and the closer to 2012 skill icons from Shredits pack so that why this mix was created

So it has the flair of the time era just as HD entered the game in 08 to 09.
